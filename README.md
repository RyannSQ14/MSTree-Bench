# üå≥ MSTree-Bench: Minimum Spanning Tree Benchmarking Toolkit

Welcome to MSTree-Bench! This repository offers a comprehensive toolkit for benchmarking and comparing Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees (MST) across various graph configurations. With integrated visualization tools and performance analysis reports, MSTree-Bench enables users to explore the efficiency and effectiveness of these two fundamental algorithms.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

To use MSTree-Bench, run the main script. You can specify various parameters to customize the graph configurations and algorithm choices.

```bash
python main.py --algorithm <kruskal|prim> --graph <type> --nodes <number>
```

### Example Command
```bash
python main.py --algorithm kruskal --graph random --nodes 100
```

This command benchmarks Kruskal's algorithm on a random graph with 100 nodes.

## üîç Algorithms

### Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal's algorithm finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. It operates by sorting the edges and adding them one by one, avoiding cycles.

### Prim's Algorithm

Prim's algorithm builds a minimum spanning tree by starting with a single vertex and adding the shortest edge from the tree to a new vertex until all vertices are included.

## üìä Visualization

MSTree-Bench includes built-in visualization tools to help you understand how each algorithm processes the graph. Visualize:

- Graph Structures
- Edges Added to the MST
- Final Minimum Spanning Tree

### Visualization Example
